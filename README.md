# Distributed-Chatting-System-with-Logical-Clock-Synchronization

## Project Overview
This project implements a distributed chatting system that utilizes a logical clock synchronization algorithm. The system supports multiple clients communicating through a multi-threaded server architecture, ensuring orderly communication even in the presence of delays.

## Key Features

Multi-threaded Architecture: Demonstrates proficiency in concurrent programming, allowing simultaneous client connections for real-time communication.
Logical Clock Synchronization: Implements a sophisticated algorithm to maintain the order of messages, showcasing understanding of distributed systems concepts.
User Interface: Provides an intuitive terminal-based UI for seamless interaction, highlighting skills in user experience design.
Robust Error Handling: Implements strategies for managing server disconnections and errors, reflecting a focus on user experience and reliability.

## Technical Highlights
Programming Language: Developed in Python, showcasing expertise in a widely-used programming language for networking and application development.
Data Structures: Utilizes efficient data structures to manage client connections and message ordering, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills.
Concurrency Management: Implements threading to handle multiple clients, showcasing skills in parallel processing and system design.

## How It Works
Server Initialization: The server must be started before clients can connect. This is a crucial step to ensure a functional chat environment.
Client Connection: Clients connect to the server, allowing for message exchange in a multi-threaded context.

## Messaging Process
Sending Messages: Clients can send messages, which are broadcasted to all connected clients. Each message includes a timestamp and logical clock value, demonstrating attention to detail in communication protocols.
Receiving Messages: Clients receive and display messages from others, maintaining clarity and organization through structured output.
## Skills Showcased
Distributed Systems: Understanding of complex systems involving multiple clients and a centralized server.
Concurrency: Ability to manage multiple simultaneous connections effectively.
Algorithm Implementation: Experience in applying algorithms for logical clock synchronization, enhancing message order reliability.
Problem Solving: Development of error handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience.
## Conclusion
This project exemplifies my ability to design and implement a distributed system with real-time communication capabilities. It highlights my technical skills in Python programming, system architecture, and problem-solving, making me a strong candidate for roles that require expertise in distributed systems and software development.
